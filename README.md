## 1. Overview

In a country that speaks over 200 languages, Yoruba is one of most common spoken languages in Nigeria, (spoken by more than 15% of the country’s population).

“Ba Mi Soro!” (Talk to Me!) is a website that provides interactive quizzes designed to test users’ understanding of the Yoruba language.

The site offers three quizzes which vary in difficulty. The quizzes have been designed to appeal to, and challenge, a variety of users (e.g. of different age groups and abilities in speaking Yoruba).
