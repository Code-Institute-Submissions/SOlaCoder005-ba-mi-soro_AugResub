## 1. Overview

In a country that speaks over 200 languages, Yoruba is one of most common spoken languages in Nigeria, (spoken by more than 15% of the country’s population).

“Ba Mi Soro!” is a Yoruba phrase that translates to “Talk to me!”. The Ba Mi Soro (BMS) website provides interactive quizzes and phrase sheets designed to test users’ understanding of the Yoruba language. 

**Features Overview** 

There are three quizzes which vary in difficulty and the variation in difficult is reflected in the (downloadable) phrase sheets also. The quizzes have been designed to appeal to, and challenge, a variety of users (e.g. of different age groups and abilities in speaking Yoruba). 

## 2. User Experience (UX)

The [‘5 Planes of UX Design Model’ (5PUXD)] (https://medium.com/designcentered/ux-design-5-planes-method-b1b1d6587c05#:~:text=The%20five%20planes%20%E2%80%94%20strategy%2C%20scope,the%20problem%20as%20a%20whole) provides **five** core principles used when creating websites and applications.These principles are: 

- Strategy
- Scope
- Structure
- Skeleton
- Surface

The **Strategy** and **Scope** plane in the 5PUXD model suggest that consumer trends, needs and competing services should be considered before designing applications. Arguably, these factors are essential to identifying the core deliverables of the application and its services being offered. It also helps designers clarify the applications’ relevance withing the respective industry and potential market demand.

As such, brief market research was conducted to gain insight into competing services (e.g. existing language applications) and user psychographics. It also helped identify BMS’ target audience and the perceived objectives (goals) of the site owner and users’ (first-time and re-occurring) who visit BMS. This is discussed in more detail below.

### **2.2 Competitor Analysis**

As part of competitor analysis, the following language applications were reviewed. Analysis of such applications assisted in the conceptualisation and creation of BMS’ User Experience Deign. 

Below is a list of some of the websites and applications reviewed:

- [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/)
- [Rosetta Stone](https://www.rosettastone.co.uk/lp/s1rsu/?cmp=evrev&utm_campaign=AW_Brand_NU_UK_ENG_Rosetta_Stone&gclid=CjwKCAjwoNuGBhA8EiwAFxomA-wUuYgJm4qTl1x16lP-8O47sP59mbLy7LMuiLFO-BTCp52AsadiphoCwjMQAvD_BwE)

### **2.3 Key Psychographic(s)**

Prior to creating the BMS website, some market research was conducted in the hopes to gain insight into users’ expectations when engaging with resources designed to assist in learning a language.  
The following questions were sent to a group of users who have interest in and/or are actively learning language(s) aside from their mother tongue: 

1) Do you and/or peers (e.g. friends, children, siblings, parents, partner) communicate more than one language?

If you **cannot speak** multiple languages, but would be interested in learning to:

2) Why would you like to learn another language? 

3) Which type of resources would you like to engage with when learning another language: 
 
- Conversation with others
- Books
- Applications (quizzes and games)
- Videos (TV shows/ YouTube)
- A mixture of the above

If you **can speak** multiple languages:
 
4) What other language(s) can you speak?

5) How did you learn to speak other language(s)? 

6) Did you use any of the following resources to aid your learning? 

- Conversation with others
- Books
- Applications (quizzes and games)
- Videos (TV shows/ YouTube)
- A mixture of the above

7) If you were to teach, or are teaching younger peers (e.g. your children) additional language(s) (e.g. ‘your native tongue’), which resources do you feel they would respond well to when learning the language:  

- Conversation with others
- Books
- Applications (quizzes and games)
- Videos (TV shows/ YouTube)
- A mixture of the above

The users’ responses were documented in the table below:


|Q/User| User 1 | User 2 | User 3 | User 4| 
|-------------|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------
|Q1.|N/A| N/A| N/A | N/A |

The key demographics and goals of users’ and site owners were identified through the findings derived from the market, competitor, and psychographic analysis. These factors are discussed in more detail below. 

### **2.4 Key Demographic(s)**
•	Age: 8-50
•	Sex: Men and Women
