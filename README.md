## 1. Overview

In a country that speaks over 200 languages, Yoruba is one of most common spoken languages in Nigeria, (spoken by more than 15% of the country’s population).

“Ba Mi Soro!” is a Yoruba phrase that translates to “Talk to me!”. The Ba Mi Soro (BMS) website provides interactive quizzes and phrase sheets designed to test users’ understanding of the Yoruba language. 

**Features Overview** 

There are three quizzes which vary in difficulty and the variation in difficult is reflected in the (downloadable) phrase sheets also. The quizzes have been designed to appeal to, and challenge, a variety of users (e.g. of different age groups and abilities in speaking Yoruba). 

## 2. User Experience (UX)

The [‘5 Planes of UX Design Model’ (5PUXD)](https://medium.com/designcentered/ux-design-5-planes-method-b1b1d6587c05#:~:text=The%20five%20planes%20%E2%80%94%20strategy%2C%20scope,the%20problem%20as%20a%20whole) provides **five** core principles used when creating websites and applications.These principles are: 

- Strategy
- Scope
- Structure
- Skeleton
- Surface

The **Strategy** and **Scope** plane in the 5PUXD model suggest that consumer trends, needs and competing services should be considered before designing applications. Arguably, these factors are essential to identifying the core deliverables of the application and its services being offered. It also helps designers clarify the applications’ relevance withing the respective industry and potential market demand.

As such, brief market research was conducted to gain insight into competing services (e.g. existing language applications) and user psychographics. It also helped identify BMS’ target audience and the perceived objectives (goals) of the site owner and users’ (first-time and re-occurring) who visit BMS. This is discussed in more detail below.

### **2.2 Competitor Analysis**

As part of competitor analysis, the following language applications were reviewed. Analysis of such applications assisted in the conceptualisation and creation of BMS’ User Experience Deign. 

Below is a list of some of the websites and applications reviewed:

- [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/)
- [Rosetta Stone](https://www.rosettastone.co.uk/lp/s1rsu/?cmp=evrev&utm_campaign=AW_Brand_NU_UK_ENG_Rosetta_Stone&gclid=CjwKCAjwoNuGBhA8EiwAFxomA-wUuYgJm4qTl1x16lP-8O47sP59mbLy7LMuiLFO-BTCp52AsadiphoCwjMQAvD_BwE)

**2.2.1 Valuableness of BMS** 

While the Yoruba language is commonly spoken in Nigeria, it can be argued that compared to ‘Romance languages’ (e.g. Spanish, French, Italian etc.); there are considerably fewer resources (e.g. classes, applications certified courses) that teach the language outside of the country. As such BMS intends to: 

- Add to the educational resources that teaches the Yoruba language. 
- Provide a taster of the language through interactive learning. 

**2.2.2 How does BMS differ competitors?**

As the core aim of the BMS is to add to educational resources that teaches Yoruba, the BMS does not differ considerably from other applications and websites that teach the Yoruba language. 

### **2.3 Key Psychographic(s)**

Prior to creating the BMS website, some market research was conducted in the hopes to gain insight into users’ expectations when engaging with resources designed to assist in learning a language.  

The following questions were sent to a group of users who have interest in and/or are actively learning language(s) aside from their mother tongue: 

1. Do you and/or peers (e.g. friends, children, siblings, parents, partner) communicate more than one language?

If you **cannot speak** multiple languages, but would be interested in learning to:

2. Why would you like to learn another language? 

3. Which type of resources would you like to engage with when learning another language: 
 
    - Conversation with others
    - Books
    - Applications (quizzes and games)
    - Videos (TV shows/ YouTube)
    - A mixture of the above

If you **can speak** multiple languages:
 
4. What other language(s) can you speak?

5. How did you learn to speak other language(s)? 

6. Did you use any of the following resources to aid your learning? 

    - Conversation with others
    - Books
    - Applications (quizzes and games)
    - Videos (TV shows/ YouTube)
    - A mixture of the above

7. If you were to teach, or are teaching younger peers (e.g. your children) additional language(s) (e.g. ‘your native tongue’), which resources do you feel they would respond well to when learning the language:  

    - Conversation with others
    - Books
    - Applications (quizzes and games)
    - Videos (TV shows/ YouTube)
    - A mixture of the above

The users’ responses were documented in the table below:


|Q/User| User 1 | User 2 | User 3 | User 4| 
|-------------|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------
|Q1.|N/A| N/A| N/A | N/A |

The key demographics and goals of users’ and site owners were identified through the findings derived from the market, competitor, and psychographic analysis. These factors are discussed in more detail below. 

### **2.4 Key Demographic(s)**

- Age: 8-50
- Sex: Men and Women

### **2.5 User stories: Site Owner and User goals**

#### **Goals: First-time user** 

1. Play an online quiz that can be accessed anywhere on different devices.

2. Test personal knowledge of the Yoruba language for leisure and educational purposes.

#### **Goals: Re-occurring user** 

3. Play an online quiz that can be accessed anywhere on different devices.

4. Test personal knowledge of the Yoruba language for leisure and educational purposes.

5. Strengthen ability in understanding the Yoruba language in more complex contexts (e.g. increased comprehension). 

#### **Goals: Site Owner** 

6. Provide a front-end accessible quiz. 

7. Ensure that the quiz can be accessed by users on most devices (i.e phone, tablet, laptops, and desktops).

8.  Provide content that:

    - Assists user’s knowledge and development of the Yoruba language.
    - Challenges users’ varying ability and/or understanding of the Yoruba language.
    - Can help different age-groups learn Yoruba.

9. Provide users with feedback on their quiz score.

10. Gain users’ feedback on the usefulness of the application.

### 7.2 Deployment: GitHub Pages

Below is an overview on how to deploy a project via GitHub’s GitHub Pages. This method was used to deploy the _____________________________:

1. Create a project **repository** on [GitHub](https://github.com/) using a registered GitHub account.

2. Once the repository is created, click on the repository, then the **Settings** tab, this is the last tab in the top right of the repository’s **navigation bar**. 

3. Once on the settings page, navigate to and click on **Pages** (titled as ‘Pages’ as of May 2021) listed in the left-hand menu pane.

4. Under the header - **Source**, select **master branch**  from the drop-down list. This will change the neighbouring selector box to **/(root)**.

5. Then click **Save**.

6. Wait for a minute and then **refresh** the webpage. 

7. Once refreshing, a green box with the text and clickable link; **'Your site is published at...'**. 

8. Clicking on the website’s hyperlink in the green box will direct to the live deployed website.
